> Redefining the way we interact with computers — with intelligence at the core.

## 🌟 Vision

**ai-os** is not just an OS; it's your second brain. It understands you, learns from your behavior, executes tasks proactively, and adapts itself dynamically.

> Imagine JARVIS, but running *on your laptop*, offline, and open-source.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-os
cd ai-os
```

### 2. Run Installer Script (Linux only for now)

```bash
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

This will install:

* Python 3.10+
* Whisper.cpp
* Ollama (for local LLMs)
* Required Python packages

### 3. Launch AI Shell

```bash
python3 apps/ai-shell/main.py
```

Example:

```
> Find all documents from Aman with charts.
> Organize my downloads folder.
> What's my most used app last week?
```

## 🧩 Plug-In System

Add your own AI skills easily:

```json
{
  "name": "summarize-pdf",
  "description": "Summarizes a given PDF file",
  "command": "python3 plugins/summarize_pdf/main.py {file_path}"
}
```

The shell will auto-load it and let users call:

```
> Summarize this report: report.pdf
```

## 🧠 Local AI Models Used

| Component        | Model                       | Backend |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| Voice Commands   | Whisper.cpp                 | CPU/GPU |
| NLP Commands     | Mixtral / Llama3 via Ollama | CPU/GPU |
| Memory/Embedding | InstructorXL / all-MiniLM   | CPU     |

You can modify models in `config/settings.yaml`.
